# Overview

A simple, efficient Unix shell implementation that serves as a command line interpreter (CLI). The project aims to build a basic shell that can interpret and execute user commands in response to prompts, providing fundamental shell functionality for Unix-like systems.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Shell Architecture
The system follows a traditional shell architecture pattern with the following key components:

- **Command Parser**: Interprets user input and breaks down commands into executable components
- **Process Management**: Handles process creation, execution, and management for running commands
- **I/O Handling**: Manages input/output operations between the shell and executed processes
- **Built-in Commands**: Implements essential shell built-ins that don't require external process execution

## Design Patterns
- **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)**: The shell operates on a continuous loop of reading user input, evaluating/executing commands, and printing results
- **Process Forking**: Utilizes Unix process forking mechanisms to execute external commands while maintaining shell state
- **Signal Handling**: Implements proper signal management for process control and user interaction

## Programming Language
The project appears to be implemented in C, which is the traditional choice for Unix shell development due to its:
- Direct access to system calls
- Efficient memory management
- Close integration with Unix/Linux operating system APIs
- Performance characteristics suitable for system-level programming

# External Dependencies

## System Dependencies
- **Unix/Linux Operating System**: Required for system calls and process management
- **Standard C Library**: For basic I/O operations, string manipulation, and system interfaces
- **POSIX APIs**: For process control, file operations, and signal handling

## Development Tools
- **C Compiler**: GCC or similar for building the shell executable
- **Make/Build System**: Likely uses standard Unix build tools for compilation

The project maintains minimal external dependencies to ensure portability and simplicity, relying primarily on standard Unix system calls and C library functions.
